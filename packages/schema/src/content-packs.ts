/**
 * Per-vertical content packs (issue #85).
 *
 * A pack is a better generation prior + a lower floor for a hand-written
 * config: trade-generic default services and CTA copy so a config with just
 * business facts still renders a complete page. Packs never contain business
 * facts (phone, hours, service areas, reviews, address) — those come from
 * intake only (golden rule #5, CLAUDE.md). `defineClient()` merges a pack in
 * with override-only semantics: any field the config sets explicitly wins.
 *
 * FAQ entries are part of the fix shape but deferred here — there is no FAQ
 * section in `ClientConfigSchema` yet (tracked in #33); add pack FAQ content
 * once that section type lands.
